I set myself the following additional goal (devised by me):

I decided to make a program that would calculate Euler's Number, the base of the natural logarithm.

To do this I used the sum of the infinite series (1/n!) which is valid for e as n approaches infinity. Since it is not possible to actually calculate up to infinity I decided to have my program prompt the user for input which is then taken as the number of terms n the series to sum.

My solution contains only one file:
*  EulersNumber.cpp = reads user input for the number of terms to calculate then outputs the calculated value for e.
